# Creating an Assistant and Uploading a File with OpenAI API

This guide demonstrates how to create a new assistant using the OpenAI Assistants API and upload a file to it using JavaScript (Node.js). The process involves making HTTP POST requests to the OpenAI API, which requires the Axios library for handling these requests. Please feel free to modify these functions as this is intended to be a starting point after converting the functions from Python to Node.js

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- An OpenAI API key, obtained from your OpenAI account.
  - This part is important as well for the developer as it is easier to monitor what assistants have been generated by looking at the Assistants console at https://platform.openai.com/assistants
- Axios library installed in your Node.js project. If Axios is not installed, you can add it by running `npm install axios` in your project directory.

## Setup

Ensure your OpenAI API key is stored securely. One method is to use an environment variable. You can place your API key in a `.env` file in the root of your Node.js project:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
# Function Descriptions

The JavaScript code provided demonstrates various functionalities, including creating assistants, fetching and processing AI-generated text, generating PDF documents, and converting text to audio. Below is an explanation of each function within the script.

## Assistant Creation and File Upload

### `createAssistant`

- **Purpose**: Creates a new assistant via the OpenAI API.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request to OpenAI with details about the new assistant, such as its name and description. Uses Axios for the HTTP request.
- **Returns**: The ID of the created assistant.

### `createAssistantFile`

- **Purpose**: Uploads a file to the newly created assistant.
- **Parameters**: `assistantId` (ID of the assistant), `fileContent` (contents of the file to upload).
- **Process**: Prepares and sends a multipart/form-data POST request to OpenAI, attaching the file intended for the assistant.
- **Returns**: Details of the created file.

## Interaction with OpenAI API for Text and PDF Manipulation

### `waitOnRun`

- **Purpose**: Polls the status of an OpenAI API call until it completes.
- **Parameters**: `run` (the initial run object), `threadId` (ID of the thread being monitored).
- **Process**: Repeatedly checks the run's status at half-second intervals until it's no longer "queued" or "in_progress".
- **Returns**: The final run object, indicating completion.

### `getResponse`

- **Purpose**: Retrieves messages from a thread in the OpenAI API.
- **Parameters**: `threadId` (ID of the thread to retrieve messages from).
- **Process**: Makes a GET request to fetch messages from the specified thread, ordering them by descending creation time.
- **Returns**: The fetched messages.

### `prettyPrint`

- **Purpose**: Prints messages to the console in a readable format.
- **Parameters**: `messages` (array of message objects).
- **Process**: Iterates over the messages array, logging each message's role and text content.
- **Returns**: None.

### `aiAssistant`

- **Purpose**: Sends user input to an AI assistant and fetches the response.
- **Parameters**: `userInput` (text input from the user), `threadId` (ID of the thread to use), `assistantId` (ID of the assistant to invoke).
- **Process**: Posts the user's message to the thread, creates a run with the specified assistant, waits for the run to complete, and then retrieves and returns the assistant's message.
- **Returns**: The assistant's response text.

### `pdfAgent`

- **Purpose**: Serves as a placeholder for a function tailored to handle PDF-specific tasks using the AI assistant.
- **Parameters**: `convoInput` (input for the conversation), `threadId`, `assistantId`.
- **Process**: Not fully implemented in the provided code, but would likely follow a similar pattern to `aiAssistant`, customized for handling PDFs.
- **Returns**: Potentially the processed PDF or relevant output.
- **Very Important**: In order to use pdfAgent, you will need to create an assistant using `createAssistant` function and passing the `pdfprompt.txt` as context and save the assistantId for this agent. Then you will need to also upload the documents to this pdfAgent in order for the assistant to generate. 
## PDF Generation

### `textToJson`

- **Purpose**: Converts PowerPoint-like text to JSON format using GPT-3.5. Note that GPT-4 may generate better results, but from my testing GPT-3.5 seemed to do ok.
- **Parameters**: `pptText` (text intended for conversion).
- **Process**: Sends the text to GPT-3.5 via an OpenAI API call, requesting a JSON-formatted response.
- **Returns**: The JSON-parsed text, ready for further processing or use.

### `createPdfFromJson`

- **Purpose**: Generates a PDF document from JSON data.
- **Parameters**: `jsonData` (the content to include in the PDF, as JSON), `pdfPath` (file path for the generated PDF).
- **Process**: Creates a new PDF document, adds text from the JSON data, and saves the document to the specified path.
- **Returns**: None.

## Audio Response Generation

### `simulateAssistantResponse`

- **Purpose**: Fetches a simulated response from an AI assistant.
- **Parameters**: `userInput` (the user's question or input), `threadId` (ID of the thread for the assistant).
- **Process**: Invokes `aiAssistant` to get a text response based on the user input.
- **Returns**: The text response from the assistant.

In addition to explaining these functions, the document highlights the use of asynchronous JavaScript features (`async/await`), the Axios library for HTTP requests, and the `pdf-lib` library for PDF manipulation. Each function is tailored to interact with the OpenAI API, handle PDF generation, or both, showcasing a broad application of JavaScript for AI-driven tasks.
